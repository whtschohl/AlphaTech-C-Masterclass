# Why

This Repo is here for me to keep track of all of the resources I use to develop my skills. I aim to develop myself in the direction of 6 skills and those 6 skills have thier own 6 sub skill sets that I will improve myself in. 

Active Cources will be directly placed in the "Resources" folder. Once completed, they will move to their respective subfolders in their skills.

## The 6 main skill categories:
* Technical Skills
* Interpersonal Skills
* Leadership Skills
* Entrepreneurship SKills
* Adaptability Skills
* Strategic Thinking Skills
